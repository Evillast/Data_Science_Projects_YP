# Research of factors influencing the borrower's reliability

#### Purpose of the study:

To determine the factors influencing the repayment of the loan on time. The results of the study will be taken into account when constructing a credit scoring model - a system that assesses the ability of a potential borrower to repay the loan to the bank.

#### Tasks:
- To review the data;
- To perform data preprocessing;
- To conduct exploratory data analysis:
    - Determine which factors most influence the fact of repaying the loan on time;
    - Explore exactly how various factors influence the fact of repaying a loan on time.

#### Used Libraries:
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Phik
- Pymystem3
- Nltk.stem

#### Short summary:
- Based on the results of this study, it is possible to create a portrait of a potentially reliable borrower. This is a woman over 45 years old with a work experience of 10 years or more, in the civil service or retired, or possibly the owner of a company, who is or was previously married, without children, with higher education, with an income of less than 50 thousand rubles or from 200 to 700 thousand rubles, which takes out a loan for real estate transactions.
- When building a credit scoring model, you should first of all take into account the borrowerâ€™s work experience, his age, type of employment, gender and level of education. The purpose of obtaining a loan, the number of children, income level and marital status also affect the potential reliability of the borrower; they should be taken into account secondarily.
