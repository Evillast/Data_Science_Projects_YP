<center><h1>Data_Science_Projects_YP</h1></center>

Repository contains my training projects from the “Data Science Specialist” course by Yandex Practicum.<br>
Projects are presented in the form of iPython Notebooks. Each project comes with a README markdown file.<br>

#### List of projects (will be updated as I add edited projects)<br>
