#### Purpose of the study:

To compare user behavior and musical preferences of residents of Moscow and St. Petersburg based on data from the Yandex Music service.

#### Tasks:
- To review the data;
- To Perform data preprocessing:
- To test hypotheses:
  - User activity depends on the day of the week, and differently in Moscow and St. Petersburg;
  - At the beginning and end of the week, different musical genres are most popular, some in Moscow and others in St. Petersburg;
  - Moscow and St. Petersburg generally prefer different genres of music.

#### Used Libraries:
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

#### Short summary:
- The first hypothesis was completely confirmed: the day of the week really affects user activity, and in Moscow and St. Petersburg in different ways. In Moscow, the peak of listening occurs at the beginning and end of the week, and in St. Petersburg, on the contrary, in the middle.
- Our second hypothesis was not confirmed: at the beginning and end of the week within one city, users listen to similar music, and the top 5 genres at the beginning and end of the week are the same for both cities.
- The third hypothesis was not confirmed. Contrary to our expectations, in general, preferences for musical genres in St. Petersburg resemble those in Moscow.
- Thus, the activity of Yandex Music users in Moscow and St. Petersburg manifests itself differently, but residents of both capitals prefer similar musical genres.
